    //   FromKnuckles - the hand as a rigid object: for placing things in the hand (the paddles, the stim pen) and fingers
    //                  relative to it (the stim's fingers). The same frame is built in Blender by the bakes
    //                  (bake_defib_hands.py, bake_stim_jab.py), so a baked mesh or finger pose means the same here.
    //   ReadArm      - the hand at the end of the arm: for reaching the palm onto something (DraggerArms), where "neutral" is
    //                  the straight wrist, so the fingers carry on from the forearm.
