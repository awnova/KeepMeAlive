    // replicated claim (RMPlayer.CurrentDraggerId) on every peer, so each one plays the same pickup from when it
    // learned of the claim:
    //   stance    - the dragger crouches and stows what is in their hands (locked in place from here to the lift);
    //   turn over - a body lying on its front is rolled onto its back (only where it is a ragdoll);
    //   reach     - the dragger's hands go for the body's grip (DragGrip). A crouched dragger cannot reach a body on the
    //               floor (their shoulders are 0.6-0.75 m above its grip, the arm reaches ~0.65 m), so the hands go as far
    //               as the arm stretches toward it and the body's shoulders rise over the second half to meet them: both
    //               arrive at the meet point at the same moment, on every pickup;
    //   grip      - the hands close on the shoulders;
    //   lift      - the body is lifted on from the meet point into the hold frame;
    //   hold      - the dragger is free to move; the body follows the hold frame.
    // The hold frame is a fixed place in front of the dragger (HoldX / HoldY / HoldZ, in their facing), never from the body and
    // never moved to suit the arms: the body always targets that exact place and lags behind it physically as it is pulled. The
    // arms follow the body only as far as their limit (DraggerArms.StretchLimit) and let go of the shoulders past it. The revivee's
    // real position, every ragdoll of the body and the dragger's arms all follow it, so nothing chases anything else.
