    // One arm of a player posed by the mod (the dragger's arms holding a body, the reviver's with the defibrillator), kinematic
    // and worked out afresh every frame from the bones: no simulation, so nothing springs or lags, and nothing of the game's
    // arm IK (its shoulders, elbow goals and weights come from animator curves that depend on what is in the hands) is relied
    // on. The caller says where the wrist goes, which way the hand faces and which way the elbow points; this does the rest:
    //   shoulder - the collarbone swings forward a little when the wrist is past the arm's straight reach;
    //   arm      - a two-bone solve puts the wrist exactly on the target, the elbow turned toward the bend direction;
    //   hand     - the forearm takes the roll (half at the elbow bone, the rest spread by the twist bones) and the wrist
    //              bends, within a limit, to lay the hand where it is wanted.
    // Rotations only: every bone stays on its parent, so the arm can never come off the body. Run straight after the
    // player's own late pass (BodyAnimation.AfterPlayerPose), so the game's pose is final and nothing rewrites the arms
    // afterwards. Visual only, so it runs on every peer, the player's own first-person view included.
