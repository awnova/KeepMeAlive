    // From the game's player prefab (PlayerSuperior): the ragdoll's bodies are Spine3 and each upper arm, joined by a
    // CharacterJoint on the upper arm whose anchor is its own origin and whose connected anchor is a fixed point on
    // Spine3 ((-0.139, 0.020, +-0.163) in the prefab). The collarbones in between have no body, so as a ragdoll each
    // shoulder is held at that point, whatever the collarbones were doing: it is the shoulder you see, and the same
    // point every time. A body that is not a ragdoll (the revivee's own) is held by its shoulder bones as they are.
    //
    // Spine3's axes (prefab): its children lie along -x (up the spine) and its front colliders on +y (NeckForward
    // +y, NeckBackward -y), which the front worked out here agrees with.
