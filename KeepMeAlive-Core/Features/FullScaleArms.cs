    // is (1, 1, s), s = Lerp(1, 0.65, FOV factor), about 0.65 at the default field of view), so the arms and the weapon look right
    // at a wide FOV. An arm reaching forward is then only ~65% as long, and cannot reach what the mod puts its hands on: the
    // dragged body's shoulders, the revivee's chest. The game turns the compensation off itself when the hands must reach
    // something in the world (DoorInteractState: MovementContext.FovCompensationOn). This does the same for as long as the mod
    // poses a player's arms, and puts it back after.
